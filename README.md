# alienSurvivalGame
A c++ console, turn-based survival game.

This is a simple game that I created as my final project for CS162 at Oregon State University. The assignment was very open-ended
(literally, create a video game), and is intended to show case many of skills I learned in the class such as inheritance, polymorphism,
and virtual functions. The game has an in-depth explanation of how to play, so I'll leave explaining that to the game.

# Usage
First, ensure you have the g++ compiler installed. Then git clone this repo and run make. This will create an executable, alienSurvival.exe, that will run the simulation. Just follow the on-screen instructions from there. Once you are done, make clean will remove the .o and executable files.
