# alienSurvivalGame
A c++ console, turn-based survival game.

This is a simple game that I created as my final project for CS162 at Oregon State University. The assignment was very open-ended
(literally, create a video game), and is intended to show case many of skills I learned in the class such as inheritance, polymorphism,
and virtual functions.
